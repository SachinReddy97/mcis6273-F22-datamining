I saw similar notebooks on Kaggle.com. This platform also uses the same jupyter notebook format and it has become a regular practice to use notebooks due to its vast applications. \n",

Each cell of code can be provided by detailed description, so that even after reading the code after years, one can easily understand all the steps done in the code. It becomes the most important advantage of using notebooks."

Using Github the work done on the notebooks will be uploaded on profile simulteneously and at the end of the semester, all the codes will be available for other to see as the open source.
